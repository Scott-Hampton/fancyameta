						It was just like any other gig I had done over the past year and a half.  Maybe one or two drinks throughout the night, but my playing was fine, and I was fine to drive as well. Well, friends, let's just say that although I am still here, my car on the way back didn't survive the crash, and unforunately, neither did my lips.
						<br><br>
						Apparently some parts of my car slammed directly on my mouth, ripping a huge gash in my upper lip. My automobile situation will be fine enough, I'll figure that out. Why I'm here today is to ask for help. Based on the crash and what they had to do to reconstruct my lips, I'll never be able to play a brass instrument again without agonizing pain.  I'm done with that, God decided it was over. So... what do I do?  What activity do I pick up as my side-thing?
						<br><br>
						The simple answer would "just pick up piano or guitar or something, you were already good at music". It's not so simple - I've tried to do some piano-ing in the past, but I straight up just don't vibe with it. Guitar... meh, everybody tries to play guitar. I want something unique, something that fits me. My girlfriend always loved hearing me doodle on my trumpet, and now that piece of me is gone.
						<br><br>
						Anyways, if you have any ideas, I'd love to hear them. I down to any discussion with any of y'all that would read this. I'm available at email@email.com.  Hit me up, and if you're in the Scranton, Ohio area, let's get a beer sometime.
