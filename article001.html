				<h2>Before the Head Injuries</h2>
				
					<p>
				
						Trust me, I know that I was never going to be any sort of professional or collegiate tar football player, but being raised the way I was, football was quite literally everything for me through age 15. There was nothing like the gladitorial nature of running over people and working as a team to dominate the oppposition.   As Russ Grimm once said "There's no greater feeling than moving a man from Point A to Point B, against his will". Playing as a lineman my entire illustrious career (AKA 4th-9th grade), I couldn't care less that I wasn't in the spotlight, all I wanted to do was go on there and hit people. It especially didn't matter how proper my blocking technique was, considering whatever I was doing was working. Ignoring how not to use my head led to me quitting football, but in all honesty, even if I used marginlly better technique, it's just the nature of the game at that age to utilize whatever conglomeration of mass you were gifted with - my leaving footbll was inevitable.

						The first concussion was standard stuff, really. I just accidentally got blindsided during a practice during 6th grade, and my head damn near blew right off my head. Easy fix, don't let your guard down.  The second one, though, was quite the doosy.  It was like the second to last game of 9th grade, and I only remember the first quarter of the game and taking repeated seemingly-subconcussive blows to the head from this sasquatch-looking dude.  After that, things went dark on me for the rest of the game. Apparently, my teammates tried to snap at me and get my attention, but I wouldn't respond. Realizing that having multiple concussions before reaching even JV was a huge red flag, I decided to drop football, a heartbreaking life event for an innocent 9th grader such a I at the time. 
						<br><br>
						Looking for a new activity and group to be a part of after getting rejected by my other favorite clubs at the school, I saw that water ppolo tryouts were open, and saw fit to try it out. Safe to say I was absolutely horrible my freshman year at it during the Spring.  However, little by little I got better with each season and with each summer, and in seemingly a blink of an eye, I tranformed from some 220lb 15 year old goblin beheamoth to your standard, slim-ish 180lb senior water polo player, and captain of the team (it's okay, I'm now back closer to my goblin weight... thank you, college!).
						<br><br>
						The biggest factor in learning how to adapt to my new situation was being with decent people - I can't tell you enough about how much it meant to me that those upperclassmen my 1st year in polo didn't constantly berate me, because they easily could have. Secondly, embracing the pain that came with trying to transistion between two completely different sports was key. I could barely float when I first started swimming workouts, but again, the slow grind resulting in me being able to hold my ground with most anyone I met in the pool. These two factors are key in being jut what I needed for what I was doing, and applying these factors can help with that transistion anywhere in life.
